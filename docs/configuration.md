# Computer configuration

First things first, you need to ensure you have everything you'll need installed on your computer. Go ahead and visit the [dependencies](/dependencies.md) page for a comprehensive list. If you are missing any of the programs, click the name of the program on the page and follow the install instructions on the program home page. Once you've configured your computer as needed, you'll be ready to set up your React.js application.

## Create a project location

You're going to do all of your development and testing locally on your machine. Those laughable days of cowboy coding are over! To do this, you need to create a folder on your machine in an easily found location. One without spaces is preferable, to avoid any issues with `console` or the browser. Ideally, create a `dev` folder at the root of your `C:\` drive.

Once you have your folder location created, you can open the project 1 of 2 ways.

- Right click in Windows Explorer and click `open with code`
- Open Visual Studio Code and click `File/open folder` then navigate to the location of your folder and click `Open`
