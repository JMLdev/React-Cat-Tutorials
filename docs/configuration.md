# Computer configuration

First things first, you need to ensure you have everything you'll need installed on your computer. Go ahead and visit the [dependencies](/dependencies.md) page for a comprehensive list. If you are missing any of the programs, click the name of the program on the page and follow the install instructions on the program home page. Once you've configured your computer as needed, you'll be ready to set up your React.js application.
