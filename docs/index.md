# Introduction

Welcome to our in-depth React.js course. The goal of this course is to teach several crucial React concepts such as, app, component, state, props, etc. We aim to achieve this goal through an interactive tutorial style lesson. If you follow along and write the code as you work your way through, you will end up with an interactive website application that lets you [vote if cats are cute or not](https://jmldev.github.io/cat-cute/#/). You should walk away with a much clearer concept of what React is and how it all works.
